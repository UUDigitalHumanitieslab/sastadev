============
This is the documentation for SASTA dev, a set of python scripts useful during development of new versions of SASTA.

The SASTAdev modules can be found in the  git repository: https://github.com/UUDigitalHumanitieslab/sastadev.


There is also a whole range of scripts that are usful in developing SASTA, with separate documentation, which can be found here: https://github.com/UUDigitalHumanitieslab/sasta-scripts.

The documentation is a work in progress, and can not be considered as final.
